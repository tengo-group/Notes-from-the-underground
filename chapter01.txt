The great source of both misery and disorders of human life, seems to arise from over-rating the difference between one permanent situation and another.
Some of those situations may, no doubt, deserve to be preferred to others: but none of them can should be pursued with such passionate ardour which drives 
us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice; or to corrupt the future tranquillity of our minds, either by shame from the remembrance of our 
own folly, or by remorse from the horror of our own injustice.
