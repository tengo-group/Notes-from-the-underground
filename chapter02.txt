Without borders, everything mashed into the same untenable state of undifferentiated chaos and you can not live in that. Therefore, people who are 
trying to tear down borders conceptually, politically and practically what they actually do unconsciously is that their wishful thinking blinds them 
too foolishly to not know that their pursuits will produce that undesirable consequences. If you on the other hand stand up for borders and keeping 
things a bit more subdivided it does not make you bigots beyond redemption. It just makes you a someone with some sense and it's all right to bring 
some common sense to the table. You are not a morally reprehensible demon. You are just cautious enough of who are you opening your house to and that 
is a sensible idea to propose. Therefore there is no need to apologise for it.
