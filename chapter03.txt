There are strong reasons for believing that what to us appear the worst features of an existing totalitarian system are not accidental byproducts, 
but phenomena which totalitarianism is certain sooner or later to produce. Just as democratic stateman who sets out to plan economic life, 
will soon be confronted with the alternative of either assuming dictetoral power or abandoning his plans, so the totalitarian dictator would soon
have to choose between disregard of ordinary morals or failure. It is for this reason that unscrupulous and uninhibited are likely to be more 
successful in a society tending towards totalitarianism. The utter difference between the whole moral atmosphere under collectivism and the 
essentially individualist western societies.
